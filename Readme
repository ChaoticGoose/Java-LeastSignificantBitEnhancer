This application is designed to enhance the Least Significant bit of each channel of an image, to allow visualation of potential setganography

All images that are to be processed should be put into a folder called "inputs" in the working directory

Automatic Usage, relies on there being an output folder, which has the same directory structure as the input folder
	find inputs/* | grep [.] | (cat - && echo "exit") | java LSBE
	
in order to replicate the inputs folders into the outputs folders, use
	mkdir -p outputs; find inputs -type d -exec mkdir -p outputs/{} \;
	
A bash script has been added, to allow for easy automation.
	This script will:
		Copy the file structure of "inputs" to "Outputs"
		Run the program on each file, and then exit the program
To find the processed files, look in "outputs/inputs/*"
